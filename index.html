    		  	<p class="main">Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. Give thanks to the most high. They don’t want us to win. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat.</p>

				<p class="main">The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! They don’t want us to win. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started.</p>

				<p class="main">The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Don’t ever play yourself. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile.</p>
